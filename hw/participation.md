- A concept or skill you found engaging or useful
- Interest in further exploration of the topic  
- How you plan to apply the knowledge to your work 
- Challenges faced and suggestions for improvement  
- Feedback on teaching methods and materials  
- A simple ‘thank you’ if no specific feedback is needed  

### Instructions

- Answer participation questions in the videos (if applicable) within the exit ticket discussion
- Exit tickets are due with weekly homework  
- Submit a participation log at the end of each module
