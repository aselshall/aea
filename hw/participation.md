## [Participation Log](https://aselshall.github.io/aea/hw/participation)

### Overview
A major part of your participation grade is based on weekly video exit tickets. Each module includes an exit ticket discussion post. At the end of each module, submit your participation log by **following these instructions**.  

### Objectives:
The objectives of this participation log are to promote:
- time management and consistent engagement with course content through adherence to weekly deadlines
- accountability with accurate participation logs aligned with Canvas records to ensure fair grading and prevent grading disputes

### Exit Ticket  
After each video, reflect and submit your exit ticket by responding to participation questions (if provided) or by sharing general insights. Your response can include:  
- A concept or skill you found engaging or useful
- Interest in further exploration of the topic  
- How you plan to apply the knowledge to your work 
- Challenges faced and suggestions for improvement  
- Feedback on teaching methods and materials  
- A simple ‘thank you’ if no specific feedback is needed  

### Instructions
- Watch 2-4 videos per week and submit an exit ticket for each
- Answer participation questions in the videos (if applicable) within the exit ticket discussion
- Exit tickets are due with weekly homework  
- Submit a participation log at the end of each module  
- Log your participation by recording video title, date watched, exit ticket date, comments (include how many participation questions you answered, if any)

| Lesson 1.2 Dimensional analysis review: Dimensional homogeneity | Jan 08, 2025     | Jan 08, 2025         |  |  

### Grading
- Full Credit for all exit tickets submitted on time, participation questions fully answered, and participation log matches Canvas records
- Partial credit for incomplete/mismatched logs or late submissions (for detail, see[late submission policy](https://aselshall.github.io/aea/#late-homework-policy))
- No Credit for missed exit tickets or participation Log
