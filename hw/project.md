# Project: Application of Course Concepts to Professional Practice

## 1. Overview
Select a concept or method that you have learned during the course and apply it to a real-world problem or scenario relevant to your current job, future career, or area of interest within water resources engineering, environmental engineering, construction management, or a related field. The project can be conducted individually or in a group of two to three students. 

## 2. Learning objectives
1. Apply course concepts such as mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistics in a real-world context
2. Relate course methods to your job or career goals
3. Analyze and solve complex engineering problems and provide practical solutions
4. Present technical findings clearly and professionally

## 3. Guidelines
Choose a concept from mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistical analysis and demonstrate its application in your profession or a field you wish to pursue. Example applications include:
- Water resources engineering: Use optimization methods to analyze pumping test data by fitting field data to a theoretical curve
- Environmental engineering: Develop a mathematical model for a bioreactor and solve it numerically or analytically
- Construction management: Apply sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to conduct cost analysis

## 4. Deliverable
Prepare a short report (3-5 pages) that includes:
- Introduction: Briefly describe the real-world problem or scenario
- Concept explanation: Explain the course concept/method and how it relates to the problem
- Application: Describe how the concept/method is applied to solve or address the problem
- Conclusion: Reflect on how this application is relevant to your professional development or future goals

## 5. Evaluation
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Relevance (30%): How well the chosen concept/method relates to course material and its applicability to a real-world problem in your field
- Application (40%): Depth of understanding and thoroughness in applying the concept/method to a practical problem
- Clarity and structure (30%): Quality of explanation, organization, and presentation of the report, including clear technical language and professional formatting

## 6. Rubric

| **Criteria**             | **Excellent (90-100%)**                                  | **Good (75-89%)**                                    | **Fair (<74%)**                                    |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Relevance (30%)**       | **30-27 points** <br> Strong connection to course material, clearly applied to your field with thoughtful reflection on real-world use. | **26-23 points** <br> Clear connection to course material, with some practical relevance and reflection | **<22 points** <br> Some connection to course, but weak relevance to the field or limited reflection | 
| **Application (40%)**     | **40-36 points** <br> Deep understanding, thorough application with clear analysis, models, and practical insights | **35-30 points** <br> Good understanding and application, though some analysis may lack depth | **<29 points** <br> Basic understanding with incomplete analysis or unclear application | 
| **Clarity & Structure (30%)** | **30-27 points** <br> Well-organized, clear, precise explanations with proper use of technical terms. Figures/tables/citations are well-integrated and error-free | **26-23 points** <br> Mostly organized with minor issues. Explanations are clear but lack precision in areas. Minor errors in formatting | **<22 points** <br> Some disorganization and unclear explanations. Multiple errors in grammar or formatting |
