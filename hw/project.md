# [Project: Application of Course Concepts to Professional Practice](https://aselshall.github.io/aea/hw/project)

## 1. Overview
Select a concept or method that you have learned during the course and apply it to a real-world problem or scenario relevant to your current job, future career, or area of interest within water resources engineering, environmental engineering, construction management, or a related field. This project will require some independent learning, as you will need to research and apply course concepts such as mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistical analysis to a real-world problem. The project can be conducted individually or in a group of two to three students. 

## 2. Learning objectives
1. Apply course concepts such as mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistics in a real-world context
2. Relate course methods to your job or career goals
3. Analyze and solve complex engineering problems and provide practical solutions
4. Present technical findings clearly and professionally

## 3. Guidelines
Choose a concept from mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistical analysis and demonstrate its application in your profession or a field you wish to pursue. Example applications include:
- Water resources engineering: Use optimization methods to analyze pumping test data by fitting field data to a theoretical curve
- Environmental engineering: Develop a mathematical model for a bioreactor and solve it numerically or analytically
- Construction management: Apply sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to conduct cost analysis

## 4. Deliverable
Prepare a short report (2-4 pages) that includes:
- Introduction: Briefly describe the real-world problem or scenario
- Concept explanation: Explain the course concept/method and how it relates to the problem
- Application: Describe how the concept/method is applied to solve or address the problem
- Conclusion: Reflect on how this application is relevant to your professional development or future goals

## 5. Evaluation
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Relevance (30%): How well the chosen concept/method relates to course material and its applicability to a real-world problem in your field
- Application (40%): Depth of understanding and thoroughness in applying the concept/method to a practical problem
- Clarity and structure (30%): Quality of explanation, organization, and presentation of the report, including clear technical language and professional formatting

## 6. Rubric

| **Criteria**             | **Excellent (90-100%)**                                  | **Good (75-89%)**                                    | **Fair (60-74%)**                                    | **Needs Improvement (<60%)**                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Relevance (30%)**       | **30-27 points** <br> Strong connection to course material, clearly applied to studentâ€™s field with thoughtful reflection on real-world use. | **26-23 points** <br> Clear connection to course material, with some practical relevance and reflection. | **22-18 points** <br> Some connection to course, but weak relevance to the field or limited reflection. | **<18 points** <br> Loosely connected to course material, with little relevance or reflection. | 
| **Application (40%)**     | **40-36 points** <br> Deep understanding, thorough application with clear analysis, models, and practical insights. | **35-30 points** <br> Good understanding and application, though some analysis may lack depth. | **29-24 points** <br> Basic understanding with incomplete analysis or unclear application. | **<24 points** <br> Limited or incorrect understanding, little analysis, and unclear application. | 
| **Clarity & Structure (30%)** | **30-27 points** <br> Well-organized, clear, precise explanations with proper use of technical terms. Figures/tables are well-integrated and error-free. | **26-23 points** <br> Mostly organized with minor issues. Explanations are clear but lack precision in areas. Minor errors in formatting. | **22-18 points** <br> Some disorganization and unclear explanations. Multiple errors in grammar or formatting. | **<18 points** <br> Poorly organized, unclear explanations, with multiple errors in structure or formatting. | 

## 7. Submission
- Submit your report as PDF on Canvas by the due date
- Upload your supporting materials such as codes or spread sheets on Canvas
- Follow the late submission policy as outlined in the course syllabus
- Contact the instructor early if you anticipate any issues with meeting the deadline

## 8. FAQ 
The instructor will regularly update this section throughout the project to answer common questions and clarify any uncertainties that students may have. Make sure to check this section before submitting your project deliverables.

**1. Are there any project themes or topics that we are restricted to?**   

While there is no strict limitation on project themes, your chosen topic should fall under the broader umbrella of advanced engineering analysis. Your project should demonstrate the application of concepts/methods covered in this course and your problem-solving skills.

**2. In case I do not have a project idea, how can I find one?**
- Leverage on a project that you currently doing at work, or for your graduation
- Check problems that we solved in this course or similar ones in your textbook
- Consult with your instructor or supervisor, who may have suggestions that suit your interests and learning goals

**3. Do In need to submit my code or Excel sheets?**   
Yes, codes or Excel sheets that you developed as part of your analysis should be submitted along with your report. Ensure they are clearly labeled and easy to follow for review.
