# Project: Application of Course Concepts to Professional Practice

## 1. Overview
Select a concept or method they have learned during the course and apply it to a real-world problem or scenario relevant to your current job, future career, or area of interest within water resources engineering, environmental engineering, construction management, or a related field. The project can be conducted individually or in a group of two to three students. 

## 2. Learning objectives
1. Apply course concepts such as mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistics in a real-world context
2. Relate course methods to your job or career goals
3. Analyze and solve complex engineering problems and provide practical solutions
4. Present technical findings clearly and professionally

## 3. Guidelines
Choose a concept from mathematical modeling, optimization, or statistical analysis and demonstrate its application in your profession or a field you wish to pursue. Example applications include:
- Environmental engineering: Develop a mathematical model for a bioreactor and solve it numerically or analytically
- Water resources engineering: Use optimization methods to analyze pumping test data by fitting field data to a theoretical curve
- Construction management: Apply sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to conduct cost analysis

## 4. Deliverable
Prepare a short report (3-5 pages) that includes:
- Introduction: Briefly describe the real-world problem or scenario
- Concept explanation: Explain the course concept/method and how it relates to the problem
- Application: Describe how the concept/method is applied to solve or address the problem
- Conclusion: Reflect on how this application is relevant to your professional development or future goals
