### Introducing the Concept of a Mathematical Model

A **mathematical model** is a representation of a real-world system or problem using mathematical language. In a model, we relate a **dependent variable** (the quantity we want to predict or understand) to **independent variables**, **parameters**, and **forcing functions** that describe the system’s behavior.

In general, a mathematical model can be expressed as:

$$ \text{Dependent Variable} = f(\text{Independent Variables, Parameters, Forcing Functions}) $$

Where:
- **Dependent Variable**: The outcome or response we are trying to predict.
- **Independent Variables**: Variables that can be controlled or varied in the system (e.g., time, position).
- **Parameters**: Fixed characteristics or properties of the system (e.g., material properties).
- **Forcing Functions**: External influences or inputs to the system (e.g., applied force, temperature).

### Example Question: How Much Load Do I Need to Break a Table?

Let’s consider the question: **“How much load is needed to break a table?”**

To find the answer, we have two approaches:
1. **Experimentally**: Gradually increase the load until the table breaks and measure the load required.
2. **Mathematical Modeling**: Use a mathematical model to predict the load required to break the table based on its material properties, dimensions, and structure.

We’ll focus on the **mathematical modeling** approach here.

### Developing a Mathematical Model for Breaking a Table

1. **Define the Dependent Variable**:
   - The outcome we want to predict is the **breaking load** (let’s denote it as $$F_{\text{break}} $$).

2. **Identify the Independent Variables**:
   - The **position** where the load is applied (e.g., center vs. edge of the table) can affect the breaking load.

3. **Parameters**:
   - **Material properties** (e.g., strength or modulus of rupture of the table material).
   - **Dimensions** of the table (e.g., length, width, thickness).

4. **Forcing Functions**:
   - The **applied force** \( F \), which increases over time until the table reaches its breaking point.

### Mathematical Model Formulation

Based on structural mechanics, a basic model for predicting the breaking load of a simply supported table subjected to a load \( F \) at the center can be expressed as:


$$F_{\text{break}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{max}} \cdot I}{y}$$


Where:
- $$\sigma_{\text{max}}$$ = Maximum stress the material can withstand before breaking (material property).
- $$I$$ = Moment of inertia of the table cross-section.
- $$y$$ = Distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber (related to table thickness).

This formula indicates that the breaking load $$F_{\text{break}}$$ depends on the **material strength** (a parameter), **dimensions of the table** (parameters like $$I$$) and $$y$$, and **position of applied force** (independent variable).

### Engaging Question for Students

**If you want to determine how much load is needed to break a table, which approach would you choose and why?**  
1. **Experimentally apply loads until it breaks**, observing and recording the results.
2. **Develop a mathematical model**, where you can use material properties and dimensions to predict the breaking load.

Think about the following:
- **What are the advantages and limitations of each approach?**
- **Which approach would be more efficient or feasible in a real engineering context?**

Thus, mathematical models allow engineers to predict and analyze systems without repeated need for physical testing.
