5.	Case study (one for each module) 
6.	Practical applications (one or more examples for each module)
7.	<span style="color:red">Homework</span> (one for each module)
8.	<span style="color:red">Survey</span> (one for each module)
For each module you need to submit participation activities, quizzes, homework, and survey.
