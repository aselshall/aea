- Exam (1 week)

You have to complete the two required modules and any two elective modules of your choice. 
- Each required module is approximately 6 lessons (i.e., 7.5 hours of contact time and 22.5 hours of studying and homework).
- Each elective module is approximately 4 lessons (i.e., 5 hours of contact time and 15 hours of studying and homework). 

Each module will contain:
1.	Lessons (2- 4 lessons)
2.	<span style="color:red">Participation activities</span> (2 answers and 1 question)
3.	Fundamental practice problems (1-3 problems for each lesson)
4.	<span style="color:red">Quizzes</span> covering basic concepts and fundamental problems (2-3 questions for each lesson) 
5.	Case study (one for each module) 
6.	Practical applications (one or more examples for each module)
7.	<span style="color:red">Homework</span> (one for each module)
8.	<span style="color:red">Survey</span> (one for each module)
For each module you need to submit participation activities, quizzes, homework, and survey.
