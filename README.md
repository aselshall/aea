General notes
- Grades Due from Faculty by Tuesday, 06 May 2024
- If you are falling behind, consult the academic calendar for the last day to drop.
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

## Participation
For participation assessment, students are expected to:
- Watch recorded videos and fill-out exit tickets
- Complete the survey at the end of each module meaningfully to provide instructor with constructive feedback and suggestions

These form the majority of your participation grade.  

## Homework
A weekly homework will be posted on Canvas. Each assignment is due by Sunday at 11:59 pm, unless otherwise posted on CANVAS. Few assignments are designed to include self-directed learning opportunities. This is to give you the opportunity to explore and experiment with engineering problems of your interest.

### Late Homework Policy
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

## Exam
- The final exam will be in-person and conducted with pencil and paper in an FE exam style.
- It will be comprehensive, covering required modules only (elective modules are not included).
- If you can solve the homework questions, you will be able to solve the exam questions.
- The exam is open-book but not open internet.
- The date and location will be announced.
- A makeup exam may be provided for students with an [execused absence](#Execused-Absence-Policy)

## Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

## Course and Program Assessment
Program Learning Outcomes for the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) Program are as follows:

### Content/Discipline Knowledge and Skills (DK) – MSE graduates will be able to:
1. Apply higher level math, science and engineering skills to research and/or design engineering systems, components, or processes to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.
2. Understand the professional and ethical responsibilities associated with engineering practice and engineering research.
3. Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice and engineering research.

Content/discipline knowledge and skills are assessed at the program level using appropriate coursework including examinations, assignments and presentations.

### Communication Skills (CS) – MSE graduates will be able to:
1. Organize and relate ideas coherently in written, oral, and graphic form.
2. Develop and present consistent arguments to diverse audiences.
Communication skills are assessed at the University, College, and Program levels through oral and written presentations, project reports, and other assignments throughout the curriculum.

### Critical Thinking Skills (CT) – MSE graduates will be able to:
1. Identify problems and the relevant information needed to solve them.
2. Analyze and synthesize information, and draw reasoned inferences.
3. Formulate and evaluate appropriate problem-solving strategies.
Critical thinking skills are assessed at the University, College, and Program levels through oral and written presentations, project reports, exams, and other assignments throughout the curriculum.

## Policy for Academic Integrity Violations 
- Academic dishonesty in assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission, and will be strictly addressed in line with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf).
- Familiarize yourself with the [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/) that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations.

## Financial Aid Statement

As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. The confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

## Generative AI Use

Generative AI including large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gimini, Claude, and DeepL should not be used in assignments and exams unless indicated by the text "Generative AI Permitted". Students must cite the used generative AI tool, and failing to do so will be considered academic dishonesty. Check FGCU Generative AI policy for more details.

## Core Syllabus Policies 

FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU. Be sure to review these [online](https://www.fgcu.edu/about/leadership/officeoftheprovost/core-syllabus-policy-statements)
